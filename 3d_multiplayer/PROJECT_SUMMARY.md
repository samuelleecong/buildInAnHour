## 🎨 Portal Configuration

### Portal Pair 1 (Blue ↔ Orange Room)
- **Portal 1**: Blue room at [-15, 2, 0], facing right
  - Colors: Cyan (#00ffff) → Magenta (#ff00ff)
- **Portal 2**: Orange room at [15, 2, 0], facing left
  - Colors: Cyan (#00ffff) → Magenta (#ff00ff)

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations
1. **Geometry/Material Reuse**: All geometries cached with `useMemo`
2. **No Object Creation in useFrame**: All vectors/quaternions pre-allocated in refs
3. **Direct Mutation**: Position/rotation updates use direct mutation (R3F best practice)
4. **Instanced Rendering**: Particle system uses single Points geometry
5. **Mobile Detection**: Lower resolution render targets + reduced effects on mobile
6. **Frame Rate Limiting**: Portal rendering at 30fps on mobile
7. **Proper Cleanup**: All resources disposed on unmount

### Expected Performance
- **Desktop**: 60 FPS with 2-4 portal pairs
- **Mobile**: 30-60 FPS with 1-2 portal pairs
- **Draw Calls**: ~50-100 per frame
- **Memory**: ~10MB for full scene + effects
